This example demonstrates a subtle issue with TypeScript type guards.  While type guards improve type safety, they don't inherently prevent runtime errors if the underlying JavaScript code is not type-safe.  This repo showcases a scenario where a type guard correctly identifies a non-number value, but a runtime error still occurs because type checking isn't strict enough to prevent the execution of the problematic line. The solution explores approaches to mitigate this and demonstrates the importance of using strict type checking and potentially runtime checks for critical operations.
